5.4.1 SIGNING OF JNLP FILES

A JNLP file can optionally be signed. 

A JNLP Client must check if a signed version of the JNLP file exists, 
and if so, verify that it matches the JNLP file that is used to launch the application. 

If it does not match, then the launch must be aborted.
 
If no signed JNLP file exists, then the JNLP file is not signed,
and no check needs to be performed.

A JNLP file is signed by including a copy of it in the signed main JAR file. 

The copy must match the JNLP file used to launch the application. 

The signed copy must be named:JNLP-INF/APPLICATION.JNLP. 

The APPLICATION.JNLPfilename should be generated in upper case, 
but should be recognized in any case. 

The signed JNLP file must be compared byte-wise against the JNLP file used to launch the application. 

If the two byte streams are identical, then the verification succeeds, otherwise it fails. 

As described above, a JNLP file is not required to be signed in order for an application to be signed. 

This is similar to the behavior of Applets, where the Applet tags in the HTML pages are not signed, 
even when granting unrestricted access to the Applet.
